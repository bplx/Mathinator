# Mathinator

I have a burning hate for Eureka Math.
Solution?
Write a python script.

# About

This is a script i made for me and my classmates to do Eureka Math way easier.
The reason why i made it is so i can get specific problems done faster without having to use a calculator.

# How to use (for my classmates!)
1. CLICK HERE!!! -----> https://repl.it/@DoIExist/MATHINATOR#main.py
2. Then extend the black window so you don't see the code, then hit enter.
3. Step 2 is very important!!!!!!!!
4. If you run into any issues, sign in with google, go to Issues, then click Create new issue. (Or something, idk)
